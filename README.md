# mind-maps
A collection of Mind Maps (created in [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home "freeplane wiki")) on various topics

While topics indeed vary, they, in general, reflect my interests, and mostly include:

* Machine Learning (including Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement learning)
* Statistics
* Mathematics
* Cognitive Psychology (computational modeling in cognitive psychology, in particular)
